# Flutter + Firebase Hosting Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates deploying a Flutter web app to Firebase Hosting using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation.

---

## üìå What Was Done

1. **Flutter Project Setup**

   * Created a Flutter app.
   * Configured it for Firebase Hosting deployment.

2. **Firebase Configuration Files**
   Added minimal Firebase configuration files to the project root:

   **`.firebaserc`**

   ```json
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "deploy-testing-8fa88"
     }
   }
   ```

   **`firebase.json`**

   ```json
   {
     "hosting": {
       "public": "build/web",
       "ignore": [
         "firebase.json",
         "**/.*",
         "**/node_modules/**"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Firebase App Config**

   * Added `google-services.json` for Android.
   * **No sensitive data was hardcoded** (keys, tokens).
   * **Firebase App ID** is stored securely in repository secrets.

4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

   * Automated build & deploy process:

     * Build Flutter web app.
     * Deploy to Firebase Hosting.

---

To get your **Firebase Deploy Token** from the command line, run:

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

### Steps:

1. Make sure you have the **Firebase CLI** installed:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Log in to your Firebase account:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Generate the token:

   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```

   * This will open a browser window for you to log in.
   * Once logged in, it will display a long token string in the terminal.

4. Copy that token and add it to your GitHub repo:

   * Go to **GitHub Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret**.
   * Name it:

     ```
     FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN
     ```
   * Paste the token as the value.


Change App Distribution in Firebase Console
Open Firebase Console ‚Üí https://console.firebase.google.com

Select your project.

In the left menu, click Release & Monitor ‚Üí App Distribution.

Choose your platform (Android or iOS) app.

Click Manage testers and groups.

You can:

Add or remove testers ‚Üí Enter their email addresses.

Create groups (e.g., ‚ÄúQA team‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeta testers‚Äù).

Move testers between groups if you want to change who gets builds.

When you upload a new build (AAB/APK/IPA), you can pick which testers or groups get it.

Save and Firebase will send them an email invite.


## üîê Repository Secrets Used

* **`FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN`** ‚Üí Used for authentication during deployment.
* **`FIREBASE_APP_ID`** ‚Üí Stores the Firebase App ID securely (instead of hardcoding it).
* Added GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON for .
* **No sensitive API keys are stored in the repo.**

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

1. Push changes to `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions builds the Flutter web app.
3. Firebase Hosting is updated automatically.

## üõ† GitHub Actions Workflow

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**

```yaml

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

* Add **Docker** for containerized builds.
* Integrate with **Google Cloud Platform** for more automation.
* Expand CI/CD to include **testing** before deployment.
